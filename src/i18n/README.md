### Translations
You can translate Hunger Games at https://crowdin.com/translate/openfoodfacts/1942. Please do not edit files directly, as translations made on GitHub will be overwritten.
If you have added or modified a string, you should update the crowdin-trigger branch from master. This will trigger import within Crowdin, and 1 hour later, it will create a new pull request with added or modified strings in all language files, plus all added or modified translations.
